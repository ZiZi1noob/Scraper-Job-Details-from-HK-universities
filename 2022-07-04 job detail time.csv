  The appointee will work for the project which investigates the ecology of feral pigeons in urban habitats in Hong Kong.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a viable solution to the sustainable population management of feral pigeons in Hong Kong and ultimately contribute to a harmonious urban ecosystem for humans, feral pigeons, and the living environments.

The three locations are (a) pigeon congregation spots around MTR Station at Kennedy Town, (b) pigeon congregation spots around Rest Garden at Ma Tau Wei Road/Ma Hang Chung Road, and (c) pigeon congregation spots around MTR Station at Hang Hau.
Characterize the ecology of feral pigeons within the concerned regions including population size and their spatio-temporal use of urban habitats over time.

These objectives will be achieved by dedicated assessment of factors influencing feral pigeon population (e.g. food source), digital technologies (e.g. drone cameras) for pigeon flock monitoring, and continuous pigeon density and population estimations (e.g. pigeon counting).
Duties
Assist in the overall project administration and logistic arrangement as project coordinator;
Lead in field surveys at the three designated locations for pigeon population estimation;
Recruit and coordinate a team of undergraduate students in assisting the project when needed;
Review and analyse data of project outcomes;
Assist in writing manuscript and organizing research activities; and
Perform any other duties as assigned.

Occasional work on weekends/holidays may be required.
